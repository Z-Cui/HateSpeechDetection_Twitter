# Method- Text Classifier

Text classification is the process of assigning tags or categories to text according to its content. Itâ€™s one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with broad applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection(fraud, hate speech, trolling etc).

# Dataset
